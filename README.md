Odin Project Foundations Project: Recipes

A small website featuring recipes (food)

Objectives:
    - Create multi-page website (html - tags/attributes, lists)
    - Increase comfort with github (creating repos, comitting & pushing changes)
    - Publish site

Conclusions:
    - I overcomplicated it
    - If I wasn't 'practicing' the step by step stuff, I could have saved a tonne of time by duplicating a template page, and dropping in the pix, ingredients, and directions.
    -(I couldn't decide if 'directions' or 'instructions' was the appropriate term to use)
